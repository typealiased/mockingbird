## What is Mockingbird?

Mockingbird is a Swift mocking framework that lets you throw away your hand-written mocks and write clean, readable tests.

- **Expansive coverage of Swift language features**
  - Mock classes and protocols in a single line of code
  - Support for generics, inheritance, static members, nested classes, type aliasing, etc.
- **Seamless integration with Xcode projects**
  - Automatic discovery of source and dependency files
  - Handling of external types from third-party libraries
- **Convenient testing API**
  - Clear stubbing and verification error messages
  - Support for asynchronous code, in order verification, default return value stubbing, etc.

### Under the Hood

Mockingbird consists of two main components: the _generator_ and the _testing framework_. Before each test bundle compilation, the generator mocks types by implementing protocols and subclassing classes. The testing framework then hooks into the generated code and provides APIs for mocking, stubbing, and verification.

A key design consideration was performance. Mockingbird runs an optimized parser built on SwiftSyntax and SourceKit that is [~30-40x faster](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Performance) than existing frameworks and supports a [broad range](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Elephant-in-the-Room#other-third-party-mocking-frameworks) of complex Swift features like generics and type qualification.

### A Simple Example

Let’s say we wanted to test a `Person` class with a function that takes in a `Bird`.

```swift
protocol Bird {
  var canFly: Bool { get }
  func fly()
}

class Person {
  func release(_ bird: Bird) {
    guard bird.canFly else { return }
    bird.fly()
  }
}
```

With Mockingbird, it’s easy to stub return values and verify that mocked methods were called.

```swift
// Given a bird that can fly
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
given(bird.getCanFly()).willReturn(true)

// When a person releases the bird
Person().release(bird)

// Then the bird flies away
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
```

## Usage

Mockingbird provides a comprehensive [API reference](https://birdrides.github.io/mockingbird/latest/) generated with [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc).

1. [Mocking](#1-mocking)
2. [Stubbing](#2-stubbing)
3. [Verification](#3-verification)
4. [Argument Matching](#4-argument-matching)
5. [Miscellaneous](#5-miscellaneous)

### 1. Mocking

Initialized mocks can be passed in place of the original type. Protocol mocks do not require explicit initialization while class mocks should be created using `initialize(…)`.

```swift
protocol Bird {
  init(name: String)
}
class Tree {
  init(with bird: Bird) {}
}

let bird = mock(Bird.self)  // Protocol mock
let tree = mock(Tree.self).initialize(with: bird)  // Class mock
```

Generated mock types are suffixed with `Mock` and should not be coerced into their supertype.

```swift
let bird: BirdMock = mock(Bird.self)  // The concrete type is `BirdMock`
let inferredBird = mock(Bird.self)    // Type inference also works
let coerced: Bird = mock(Bird.self)   // Avoid upcasting mocks
```

#### Reset Mocks

Reset mocks and clear specific configurations during test runs.

```swift
reset(bird)                    // Reset everything
clearStubs(on: bird)           // Only remove stubs
clearDefaultValues(on: bird)   // Only remove default values
clearInvocations(on: bird)     // Only remove recorded invocations
```

### 2. Stubbing

Stubbing allows you to define custom behavior for mocks to perform.

```swift
given(bird.canChirp()).willReturn(true)
given(bird.canChirp()).willThrow(BirdError())
given(bird.canChirp(volume: any())).will { volume in
  return volume < 42
}
```

This is equivalent to the shorthand syntax using the stubbing operator `~>`.

```swift
given(bird.canChirp()) ~> true
given(bird.canChirp()) ~> { throw BirdError() }
given(bird.canChirp(volume: any())) ~> { volume in
  return volume < 42
}
```

#### Stub Methods with Parameters

[Match argument values](#4-argument-matching) to stub methods with parameters. Stubs added later have a higher precedence, so add stubs with specific matchers last.

```swift
given(bird.canChirp(volume: any())).willReturn(true)     // Any volume
given(bird.canChirp(volume: notNil())).willReturn(true)  // Any non-nil volume
given(bird.canChirp(volume: 10)).willReturn(true)        // Volume = 10
```

#### Stub Properties

Stub properties with their getter and setter methods.

```swift
given(bird.getName()).willReturn("Ryan")
given(bird.setName(any())).will { print($0) }
```

Getters can be stubbed to automatically save and return values.

```swift
given(bird.getName()).willReturn(lastSetValue(initial: ""))
print(bird.name)  // Prints ""
bird.name = "Ryan"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"
```

#### Relaxed Stubs with Default Values

Mocks are strict by default, meaning that calls to unstubbed methods will trigger a test failure. Methods returning `Void` do not need to be stubbed in strict mode.

```swift
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
print(bird.name)  // Fails because `bird.getName()` is not stubbed
bird.fly()        // Okay because `fly()` has a `Void` return type
```

To return default values for unstubbed methods, use a `ValueProvider` with the initialized mock. Mockingbird provides preset value providers which are guaranteed to be backwards compatible, such as `.standardProvider`.

```swift
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
bird.useDefaultValues(from: .standardProvider)
print(bird.name)  // Prints ""
```

You can create custom value providers by registering values for types. 

```swift
var valueProvider = ValueProvider()
valueProvider.register("Ryan", for: String.self)
bird.useDefaultValues(from: valueProvider)
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"
```

Values from concrete stubs always have a higher precedence than default values.

```swift
given(bird.getName()).willReturn("Ryan")
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"

bird.useDefaultValues(from: .standardProvider)
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"
```

Provide wildcard instances for generic types by conforming the base type to `Providable` and registering the type.

```swift
extension Array: Providable {
  public static func createInstance() -> Self? {
    return Array()
  }
}

// Provide an empty array for all specialized `Array` types
valueProvider.registerType(Array<Any>.self)
```

#### Stub a Sequence of Values

Methods that return a different value each time can be stubbed with a sequence of values. The last value will be used for all subsequent invocations.

```swift
given(bird.getName()).willReturn(sequence(of: "Ryan", "Sterling"))
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Ryan"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
print(bird.name)  // Prints "Sterling"
```

It’s also possible to stub a sequence of arbitrary behaviors.

```swift
given(bird.getName())
  .willReturn("Ryan")
  .willReturn("Sterling")
  .will { return Bool.random() ? "Ryan" : "Sterling" }
```

### 3. Verification

Verification lets you assert that a mock received a particular invocation during its lifetime.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
```

Verifying doesn’t remove recorded invocations, so it’s safe to call `verify` multiple times.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()  // If this succeeds...
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()  // ...this also succeeds
```

#### Verify Methods with Parameters

[Match argument values](#4-argument-matching) to verify methods with parameters.

```swift
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: any())).wasCalled()     // Called with any volume
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: notNil())).wasCalled()  // Called with any non-nil volume
verify(bird.canChirp(volume: 10)).wasCalled()        // Called with volume = 10
```

#### Verify Properties

Verify property invocations using their getter and setter methods.

```swift
verify(bird.getName()).wasCalled()
verify(bird.setName(any())).wasCalled()
```

#### Verify the Number of Invocations

It’s possible to verify that an invocation was called a specific number of times with a count matcher.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasNeverCalled()            // n = 0
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(exactly(10))      // n = 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(atLeast(10))      // n ≥ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(atMost(10))       // n ≤ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(between(5...10))  // 5 ≤ n ≤ 10
```

Count matchers also support chaining and negation using logical operators.

```swift
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(not(exactly(10)))           // n ≠ 10
verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled(exactly(10).or(atMost(5)))  // n = 10 || n ≤ 5
```

#### Argument Capturing

An argument captor extracts received argument values which can be used in other parts of the test.

```swift
let bird = mock(Bird.self)
bird.name = "Ryan"

let nameCaptor = ArgumentCaptor<String>()
verify(bird.setName(nameCaptor.matcher)).wasCalled()

print(nameCaptor.value)  // Prints "Ryan"
```

#### In Order Verification

Enforce the relative order of invocations with an `inOrder` verification block.

```swift
// Verify that `fly` was called before `chirp`
inOrder {
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
  verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
}
```

Pass options to `inOrder` verification blocks for stricter checks with additional invariants.

```swift
inOrder(with: .noInvocationsAfter) {
  verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
  verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
}
```

#### Asynchronous Verification

Mocked methods that are invoked asynchronously can be verified using an `eventually` block which returns an `XCTestExpectation`. 

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
  Tree(with: bird).shake()
}

let expectation =
  eventually {
    verify(bird.fly()).wasCalled()
    verify(bird.chirp()).wasCalled()
  }

wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 1.0)
```

#### Verify Methods Overloaded by Return Type

Specify the expected return type to disambiguate overloaded methods.

```swift
protocol Bird {
  func getMessage<T>() -> T    // Overloaded generically
  func getMessage() -> String  // Overloaded explicitly
  func getMessage() -> Data
}

verify(bird.getMessage()).returning(String.self).wasCalled()
```

### 4. Argument Matching

Argument matching allows you to stub or verify specific invocations of parameterized methods.

#### Match Exact Values

Value types that explicitly conform to `Equatable` work out of the box. Note that structs able to synthesize `Equatable` conformance must still explicitly declare conformance.

```swift
struct Fruit: Equatable {
  let size: Int
}

verify(bird.eat(Fruit(size: 42))).wasCalled()
verify(bird.setName("Ryan")).wasCalled()
```

Class instances can be safely compared by reference.

```swift
class Tree {
  init(with bird: Bird) {
    bird.home = self
  }
}

let tree = Tree(with: bird)
verify(bird.setHome(tree)).wasCalled()
```

#### Match Wildcard Values and Non-Equatable Types

Argument matchers allow for wildcard and custom matching of arguments that don’t conform to `Equatable`.

```swift
any()                    // Matches any value
any(of: 1, 2, 3)         // Matches any value in {1, 2, 3}
any(where: { $0 > 42 })  // Matches any number greater than 42
notNil()                 // Matches any non-nil value
```

For methods overloaded by parameter type (such as with generics), using a matcher may cause ambiguity for the compiler. You can help the compiler by specifying an explicit type in the matcher.

```swift
any(Int.self)
any(Int.self, of: 1, 2, 3)
any(Int.self, where: { $0 > 42 })
notNil(String?.self)
```

You can also match elements or keys within collection types.

```swift
any(containing: 1, 2, 3)  // Matches any collection with values {1, 2, 3}
any(keys: "a", "b", "c")  // Matches any dictionary with keys {"a", "b", "c"}
any(count: atMost(42))    // Matches any collection with at most 42 elements
notEmpty()                // Matches any non-empty collection
```

#### Match Floating Point Values

Mathematical operations on floating point numbers can cause loss of precision. Fuzzily match floating point arguments instead of using exact values to increase the robustness of tests.

```swift
around(10.0, tolerance: 0.01)
```

### 5. Miscellaneous

#### Excluding Files

You can exclude unwanted or problematic sources from being mocked by adding a `.mockingbird-ignore` file. Mockingbird follows the same pattern format as [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) and scopes ignore files to their enclosing directory.

#### Using Supporting Source Files

Supporting source files are used by the generator to resolve inherited types defined outside of your project. Although Mockingbird provides a preset “starter pack” for basic compatibility with common system frameworks, you will occasionally need to add your own definitions for third-party library types. Please see [Supporting Source Files](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Supporting-Source-Files) for more information.

#### Thunk Pruning

To improve compilation times for large projects, Mockingbird only generates mocking code (known as thunks) for types used in tests. Unused types can either produce “thunk stubs” or no code at all depending on the pruning level specified.

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `disable` | Always generate full thunks regardless of usage in tests. |
| `stub` | Generate partial definitions filled with `fatalError`. |
| `omit` | Don’t generate any definitions for unused types. |

Usage is determined by statically analyzing test target sources for calls to `mock(SomeType.self)`, which may not work out of the box for projects that indirectly synthesize types such as through Objective-C based dependency injection.

- **Option 1:** Explicitly reference each indirectly synthesized type in your tests, e.g. `_ = mock(SomeType.self)`. References can be placed anywhere in the test target sources, such as in the `setUp` method of a test case or in a single file.
- **Option 2:** Disable pruning entirely by setting the prune level with `--prunelevel disable`. Note that this may increase compilation times for large projects.

### Inferred Paths

#### `--project`

Mockingbird first checks the environment variable `PROJECT_FILE_PATH` set by the Xcode build context and then performs a shallow search of the current working directory for an `.xcodeproj` file. If multiple `.xcodeproj` files exist then you must explicitly provide a project file path.

#### `--srcroot`

Mockingbird checks the environment variables `SRCROOT` and `SOURCE_ROOT` set by the Xcode build context and then falls back to the directory containing the `.xcodeproj` project file. Note that source root is ignored when using JSON project descriptions. 

#### `--outputs`

By Mockingbird generates mocks into the directory `$(SRCROOT)/MockingbirdMocks` with the file name `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME)Mocks.generated.swift`.

#### `--support`

Mockingbird recursively looks for [supporting source files](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Supporting-Source-Files) in the directory `$(SRCROOT)/MockingbirdSupport`.

#### `--testbundle`

Mockingbird checks the environment variables `TARGET_NAME` and `TARGETNAME` set by the Xcode build context and verifies that it refers to a valid Swift unit test target. The test bundle option must be set when using [JSON project descriptions](https://github.com/birdrides/mockingbird/wiki/Manual-Setup#generating-mocks-for-non-xcode-projects) in order to enable thunk stubs.
